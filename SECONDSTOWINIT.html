                <p>
                    This competition consists of 5 stages. In the first stage we will set 5 laser beams
                    in a random manner and the participant will have to crawl through, without getting
                    in contact with the beam. We can oversee it with the help of LDR.
                    The ones who pass the 1st stage will be eligible for the 2nd -stage. Here, they
                    will be given a number of password protected nested folders. They will also be
                    given all the passwords at once, and once they unlock all the folders, they will get
                    a 5 digit number. And using this number, they will have to complete a given circuit
                    by connecting the socket as per the number.
                    In the next stage, they will be given a set of 10 tech questions, and participants
                    have to complete them in 40 Seconds.
                    In the 4th stage, participants will be asked to blindly code an algorithm with
                    python. The monitor will be turned off so that they can't view the code.
                    In the final stage A cycle can be fitted with dynamo which can in turn glow up a
                    no. of lights connected in series. If we connect 5 lights, the ones who peddle the
                    cycle and if he/she is able to glow all the lights, he will be the winner.
